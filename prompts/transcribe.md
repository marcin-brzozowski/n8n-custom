# Transcription Task

## 1. Primary Goal
Your primary goal is to transcribe the provided audio into a clean, accurate, and well-formatted text. The transcription language must match the speaker's language (Polish or English).

## 2. Output Format: Clean Transcript
This is a **clean** transcript. Adhere strictly to the following rules:
- **Character Encoding**: The final output MUST be a valid UTF-8 encoded string. You are strictly forbidden from using Unicode escape sequences (e.g., \u015b, \u0142). All special characters must be rendered directly in the text (e.g., ś, ł).
- **Remove Filler Words:** Do not transcribe any filler words.
    - **English fillers to remove:** um, uh, ah, er, like, you know, I mean.
    - **Polish fillers to remove:** yyy, eee, hmm, ten, no, wiesz, po prostu, jakby.
- **Remove Non-Speech Sounds:** Omit coughs, throat clearing, and other non-speech sounds.
- **Correct Errors:** Do not transcribe stutters, false starts, or self-corrections. Transcribe the final, intended word or phrase.
    - **Example:** If the speaker says "I want to, uh, I need to connect to the data- the database," transcribe it as "I need to connect to the database."

## 3. Punctuation and Formatting
- **Punctuation:** Add appropriate punctuation (periods, commas, question marks, exclamation points) to reflect the speaker's intonation and create grammatically correct sentences.
- **Line Breaks:** Start a new line for each new sentence or distinct utterance. Do not break a single sentence across multiple lines.

## 4. Language-Specific Rules

### For Polish (`pl-PL`)
- **Diacritics:** It is **absolutely crucial** to use correct Polish diacritical marks (ą, ę, ć, ł, ń, ó, ś, ź, ż) consistently and accurately, ensuring they are rendered as direct UTF-8 characters per the rule above. This is a top priority.
- **Mixed Language:** When an English word or phrase is used within a Polish sentence, transcribe it in English and apply the English capitalization rules below.

### For English (`en-US` / `en-GB`)
- **Capitalization Rules:**
    - **Common Nouns:** Use lowercase (e.g., `oscillator`, `pipeline`, `server`).
    - **Proper Nouns:** Capitalize all proper nouns, including brands, products, technologies, and people's names (e.g., `Google Chrome`, `JavaScript`, `Marcin`, `AWS`).
    - **Code & API Identifiers:** Use verbatim, case-sensitive capitalization (e.g., `getElementById`, `useState`, `torch.Tensor`).

## 5. Handling Technical Terminology
- In general, use the English term for technical concepts, especially in computing and software development.
- **Examples:** Transcribe as `canvas`, not `płótno`; `vertex`, not `wierzchołek`; `scene`, not `scena`, when used in a technical context.
